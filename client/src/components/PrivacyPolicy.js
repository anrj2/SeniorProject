      <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Website, your information is protected both online and offline according to generally accepted industry standards.</p>
      <p>Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. All data related to your purchase orders and payment information, including shipping and returns is stored through Shopify’s data storage mechanism, databases and the general Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall. To learn more about how Shopify stores and uses your data, please view Shopify’s <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p>To protect sensitive information such as your credit card data, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
      <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
      <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
