The project aims to develop a fully functional e-commerce website for Mr. Joe Hot Sauce, a company specializing in hot sauces of various flavors and heat levels from the Caribbean. The website will serve as an online platform for customers to browse and purchase hot sauces, learn about the company's story and mission, and engage with content related to spicy food culture. It will feature an intuitive user interface, secure payment processing, and a dynamic product catalog that allows for easy navigation and selection of items. Additionally, the website will incorporate elements of branding and storytelling to create an immersive experience for visitors, emphasizing Mr. Joe's passion for crafting high-quality hot sauces.
